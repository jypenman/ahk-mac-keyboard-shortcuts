# Mac Keyboard Shortcuts for Windows 10 (AutoHotKey)

This fork has the following differences from rogersmj's version: 
1. Original Windows shortcuts will not work because this fork will enable mac-like special characters, which requires remapping of the option and control keys. 
2. Added an icon to distinguish it from other AHK instances
  2.1 (In future may enable choosing different command sets from tray icon menu)

**Purpose**: Make your muscle memory work perfectly between OS X and Windows. 

**Rationale**:
I want to use the windows key as my main control key because I get less RSI and am more accurate when my thumb activates the main control key directly to the left of hte spacebar, as opposed to my pinky activating the control key two (or sometimes three) keys away. 

This is an [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script 
For example, `Windows + C` will copy to clipboard, `Windows + V` will paste, `Windows + â†’` will jump to the end of a line, etc. The original Windows shortcuts (e.g. `Ctrl + C`) still work.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Download the `Mac-Shortcuts.ahk` file from this repository (or clone the repo) and save it somewhere on your PC.
3. Double-click the .ahk file to run the script and test out the shortcuts. If they work, you can have it [load automatically when Windows starts](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/FAQ.htm#Startup).

## Known issues
Certain Windows keyboard shortcuts cannot be "intercepted" by AHK (or at least, I haven't figured out how to do it yet). For these, the remapped functionality in this script will work, but the default Windows behavior will __also__ fire. One example is `Windows + G` which brings up the Windows Game Bar by default; we instead want this key combo to perform `Ctrl + G` for the __Find next__ functionality in web browsers. To prevent the Game Bar from showing up when you use `Windows + G`, you have to go to the Game Bar Shortcuts in Windows settings and turn off the game bar. **If you find more examples like this, please file an issue in GitHub so I can add it to the docs.**
